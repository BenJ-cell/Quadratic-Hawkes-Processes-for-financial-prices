# Quadratic-Hawkes-Processes-for-financial-prices

This paper introduces and explores the main characteristics of the QHawkes model, an extension of the Hawkes price model by incorporating linear and quadratic feedback effects in the jump intensity based on past returns. Empirical analysis of NYSE stock data reveals structural differences in the off-diagonal component of the quadratic kernel compared to standard Hawkes models. The QHawkes model demonstrates two key properties essential for modeling volatility processes: time-reversal asymmetry similar to financial markets and the generation of fat-tailed volatility processes, particularly under exponentially decaying kernels, with connections to Pearson diffusions in the continuous limit. The paper discusses various properties of QHawkes processes, including their ability to generate long memory without being at the critical point. Numerical simulations of the calibrated QHawkes model confirm its capability to replicate fat-tails and time reversal asymmetry observed in empirical time series with minimal quadratic non-linearity.
